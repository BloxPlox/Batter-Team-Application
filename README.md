# Batter-Team-Application
CSD 2522 - Final Project

Batter Team
1. James Nagy – Lead
2. Parker Bleything
3. Nathan Minnick
4. Dakota Albritton

Tasks:
- Create a Batter class for the batting statistics for a player on the team.
- Create a graphical user interface that can be used to collect data about each batter in a game.
- Once the data has been entered, it should be written out to a file identified by the date of the game.  Each batter’s statistics should be added to the file for that date. The format of the file is up to the team to decide, binary, flat or sql-DB it is your decision.
- When the file is read, it should produce a report that lists the statistics for all batters in that game, and calculates the batting average, total bases, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage for each batter. The report should be saved in a file in a format for printing.
- There should also be a program that will read multiple game files and summarize the statistics on each batter for a specified number of games.
